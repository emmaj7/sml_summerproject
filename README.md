## Setting up the invironment
The project assumes you are running ubuntu 16.04. and that you have the following applications installed on your machine:
* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). You can install ROS by following [this guide](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) You can install them by following [this guide](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/).

Futhermore we recommend installing [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

	npm install -g nodemon

which simplifies debuggging when you're testing out your applications.
